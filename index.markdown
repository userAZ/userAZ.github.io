I am a PhD student, currently at the University of Utah, previously at the
University of Edinburgh, with my supervisor Vijay Nagarajan.

My research interests revolve around computer architecture, programming
languages (PL), and using cool PL techniques
in computer architecture to build microarchitecture that's correct
by construction.

# Research

- AQL: A DSL for microarchitecture and automatically
enforcing Memory Consistency Models (MCMs) on microarchitecture.
Generated microarchitecture is verified against litmus tests
in the Murphi model checker.

# CV

This is my [CV](https://userAZ.github.io/assets/cv.pdf).
